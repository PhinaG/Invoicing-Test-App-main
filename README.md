Hi Bjarke,

Firstly, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to complete the project by extending the deadline.

I found the project guideline a bit vague. However; I have completed the project with certain assumptions.

1. Amended the given .net core project
2. Added a new controller: ClientsController for Client CRUD operations
3. Added the missing CRUD operations to the InvoicesController
4. I adopted the same coding pattern which was used in the given project
5. Added basic unit tests
6. Amended the given vue app to meet the guideline's requirements

Awaiting for your feedback.

Thank you.
Phina
