Hi Bjarke,

Firstly, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to complete the project by extending the deadline.

I found the project guideline a bit vague. I raised my queries with Candace on Tuesday itself but it is taking long to get a feedback. However; I have completed the project with certain assumptions.

1. Updated the given .net core project
2. Added a new controller: ClientsController for Client CRUD operations
3. Added the missing CRUD operations to the InvoicesController
4. I adopted the same coding pattern which was used in the given project
5. Added basic unit tests
6. Updated the given vue app to meet the guideline's requirements

Awaiting for your feedback.

Thank you.
Phina
